(The above illustration doesn't come from this projet.)

This project aims to compare different heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TPS) and visualizing them in the browser. 

## Construction Algorithms:

* Greedy Algorithm
* Nearest Insertion
* Nearest Neighbour

## Optimization Algorithms:

* 2-opt
* 2-opt + Node Insertion
* Lin Kernighan (simplified)
* Simulated Annealing
