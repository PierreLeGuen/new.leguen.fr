## A little bit about me

<Separator />

<p class="para">

Student in an engineering school in France, currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Computer Science at Polytech' Nantes (aka Ã‰cole Polytechnique de L'UniversitÃ© de Nantes). I am in the fourth year of a 5-year program. 

Very curious to learn new things I browse Medium.com often (too often). I also occasionally write articles on my blog.

## My stack

The technologies I like to use (with no specific order): 
* Golang: Its efficiency and its reliable way of programming it offers are the things for which Go is my favorite language for now. Open Source, Fast, Compiled, Secure and maintained by Google.
* C++, and why I love it : 
    * It is a highly portable language and is often the language of selection for multi-device, multi-platform app development.
    * C++ is an object-oriented programming language and includes concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, and encapsulation which allow code reusability and makes programs very maintainable.
    * C++ use multi-paradigm programming (Generic, Imperative and Object Oriented).
    * It is useful for the low-level programming language and very efficient for general purpose.
    * C++ gives the user complete control over memory management. When well done it can be way better than a Garbage Collector.
    * And so on...
* Python: Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It offers an impressive ability to program quickly and efficiently. I often use it to describe problems.
