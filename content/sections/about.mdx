<Separator />

<p class="para">

Student in an engineering school in France, currently studying for a Master of Science in Computer Science at Polytech' Nantes (aka Ã‰cole Polytechnique de L'UniversitÃ© de Nantes). I am in the fourth year of a 5-year program. 

Very curious to learn new things I browse Medium.com often (too often). I also occasionally write articles on my blog.

The technologies I like to use (with no specific order): 
* Golang: Its efficiency and its reliable way of programming it offers are the things for which Go is my favorite language for now. Open Source, Fast, Compiled, Secure and maintained by Google, what more could you ask for?
* C++ : Cpp is cpp, faster than light !
* Python: Impressive ability to program quickly and efficiently. I often use it to describe problems.
