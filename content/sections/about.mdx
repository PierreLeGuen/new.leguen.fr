## My stack

<Separator />

The technologies I like to use (with no specific order):
* Golang: Its efficiency and its reliable way of programming it offers are the things for which Go is my favorite language for now. Open Source, Fast, Compiled, Secure and maintained by Google. I'm now moving my back-ends to Golang.
* C++, and why I love it :
    * It is a highly portable language and is often the language of selection for multi-device, multi-platform app development.
    * C++ is an object-oriented programming language and includes concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, and encapsulation which allow code reusability and makes programs very maintainable.
    * C++ use multi-paradigm programming (Generic, Imperative and Object Oriented).
    * It is useful for the low-level programming language and very efficient for general purpose.
    * C++ gives the user complete control over memory management. When well done it can be way better than a Garbage Collector.
    * And so on...
* Python: Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It offers an impressive ability to program quickly and efficiently. I often use it to describe problems.
* Docker, it has been for me such a game changing experience in my development process. Now almost all my back-ends works with docker, here is a few points why:
    * Portability: Docker containers can be run on any Linux, Windows, Mac hardware: your laptop, your local server, public or private cloud, etc. It means that, if you want, your local development environment can be exactly the same as the production environment (even if it's not recommended).
    * Isolation: Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel, so every container run within a single Linux instance is independent and isolated from the other containers as well as the host.
    * Modularity: in Docker each part of the app, like an API or a database, should be running in a separate container. This allows developers to accurately split their work.
    * Community: on Docker Hub, the ultimate source of Docker images, there are 86 official images for different tools and thousands of unofficial images created by the community. Whatâ€™s more, there are more than 50,000 repos on GitHub connected to Docker.
